  "pomodoro_definition": "The Pomodoro Technique is a time management strategy developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique involves breaking work into 25-minute intervals, called \"Pomodoros,\" separated by short breaks. After four Pomodoros, a longer break is taken. This technique helps individuals to focus on one task at a time and manage their time effectively",
